# MSAL Node for Deno

This is an implementation of the Azure MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) for Deno using msal-node. 

This project is based on the tutorial provided by Microsoft, which can be found at the following link: [msal-tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/tutorial-v2-nodejs-webapp-msal)

The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to sign in users and acquire tokens for calling Microsoft Graph in a Node.js & Express web app using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Node.

This implementation aims to provide similar functionality, but for Deno environments.
